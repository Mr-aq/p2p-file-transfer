# P2P File Transfer 🚀

Welcome to **P2P File Transfer**! 🎉 This is a super cool Python application that lets you share files directly with your friends over a local network, no middleman needed! Think of it as a digital carrier pigeon 🕊️, but faster and with less flapping. Built with a slick Tkinter GUI, this tool makes file sharing as easy as pie 🥧.

## What's This All About? 🤔

This project is a peer-to-peer (P2P) file transfer system that allows users to:
- **Discover friends** on the same network 📡
- **Add buddies** to your friend list 🤝
- **Send and receive files** securely and directly 📁
- **Choose where to save** incoming files 🗂️
- **Track transfer progress** in real-time 📊

It’s like passing notes in class, but instead of paper, you’re slinging files at lightning speed! ⚡️

## Features That Rock 🎸

- **User-Friendly GUI**: A clean Tkinter interface to manage friends and transfers with ease 😎
- **Friend System**: Search, add, and manage friends with a few clicks 👥
- **Custom Save Locations**: Pick exactly where you want your files to land 📍
- **Real-Time Updates**: Watch your file transfers zoom with progress bars 🚴‍♂️
- **Heartbeat Mechanism**: Keeps track of who's online and who's not 💓
- **Error Handling**: Robust logging to keep things smooth even when the network gets grumpy 😣
